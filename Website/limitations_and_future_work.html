			<p class="limitpara1_head"><b>Limitations</b></p>
			<p class="limit_para1">The WaveGuide utility is subject to certain limitations. 
                Primarily, the accuracy of the tracking system is contingent upon the prevailing lighting conditions. 
                Further, the utility is only efficient when the background is static, and is solely compatible with Raspbian Buster, lacking support for the latest version Bulleye, which is based on Debian 11. 
                The utility exclusively supports Xorg display server and is incompatible with Debian systems. 
                Furthermore, it is restricted to controlling the cursor of the Raspberry Pi, without the capacity to manipulate the cursor of any other system connected to it.</p>
            <p class="limitpara2_head"><b>Future Works</b></p>
			<p class="limit_para2">The WaveGuide development team proposes to address these limitations through future work, which involves the incorporation of deep learning to refine the detection of the palm area. 
                Additionally, the team aims to interconnect the utility to other systems as a network device using sockets and ensure compatibility with Wayland systems. 
                The successful implementation of these developments would position the WaveGuide utility to supplant the need for a mouse pointer and benefit a wider user base.</p>
